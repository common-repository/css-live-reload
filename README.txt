Reload all CSS Files resources on your page by just one click (if surfing via mobile Phone - shake it) without refreshing the page.

== Description ==
A simple and powerful plugin. Often we simply edit a section on our style sheet file, so why reloading the entire page?! It creates many unnecessary requests and thus makes reloading slower, instead of just reloading the css files.
Now, we can achieve that with a simple plugin, by simply clicking on f9 and then reload all Css resources on the page!

As for mobile devices debugging, you can simply shake your phone and all Css files will be reloaded.
No cache, no unnecessary requests, no more slow reloading!
